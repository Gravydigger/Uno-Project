A command line-based implementation of the card game Uno. Also contains power cards that can be used to change up
the flow of the game. Once a player is on their last card, they must call “UNO!”, else pick up two cards.
The basic implementation of this command line-based version will try to have 2 players being able to
place standard cards onto the centre pile, as well as two power cards, being a +2 and a wildcard.
